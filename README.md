# Teorem Project

## My Coding Journey

This repository represents my first steps into the world of programming. What started as a mathematical theorem exploration became the catalyst that ignited my passion for coding.

## About the Project

This project contains various Python scripts that I've written to test and improve my understanding of the theorem. Through multiple iterations and tests, I've developed different approaches to solve and analyze the problem.

### Key Files
- `Program_Matrix.py`: Matrix-based implementation
- `Program_Import.py`: Core implementation with imports
- `proValueGenerator.py`: Value generation algorithms
- `teoremTest.py`: Testing framework
- Various test files (test 1-15): Different iterations and approaches I explored

## Learning Journey

This project documents my progression from initial experiments to more structured implementations. Each test file represents a different approach or improvement in my understanding of both the theorem and programming concepts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Matrix operations
- Mathematical algorithms
