# Teorem Project

## How I Started Coding

This project is where my coding journey began. I created a math theorem called the Akin Isolation Matrices Method, which helps solve polynomial problems. To make it work better, I needed to write some code - and that's how I fell in love with programming!

## What's In Here

I wrote a bunch of Python scripts to test my theorem and make it work. The more I coded, the more I learned, and the better my programs got.

### Files You'll Find
- Multiple test scripts (`test1.py` through `test15.py`) documenting my learning process
- Value generation scripts (`value generator.py`, `proValueGenerator.py`)
- Matrix operations (`Program_Matrix.py`)
- Main program implementations (`main.py`, `Program_Import.py`)
- Various testing and calculation modules

## Tools Used
- Python
- Some matrix math
- Basic algorithms

*This was my first coding project, and it opened the door to many more exciting projects to come!*
